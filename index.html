<h3>Arthur Shelby</h3>
<p>Arthur Shelby Jr. was born to a Romani and Irish Traveller family. Growing up, Arthur regularily wrestled
with his siblings and was known as the strongest. He once got beaten by Tommy, he also once held off 12
police officers with a boat hook, showing that he let Tommy win. It is implied he had anger issues as a
child and got into many fights. During the war in France, Arthur was a Sapper with his brother Thomas,
digging very treacherous tunnels in order to place enormous amount of explosives under the enemy
positions: a tactic used several times in the war to devastating effect at both the Battle of Verdun and
the Battle of the Somme. It is suggested he may have served at Gallipoli through his distaste for Turks
and the smell of stagnant water.

<h3>Thomas Shelby</h3>
<p>Thomas served in World War I with the rank of Sergeant Major and was decorated for bravery (Though he
dumped them in a canal after returning from the war). His experiences in World War I left him
disillusioned and beset with ongoing nightmares, and he becomes determined to move his family up in the
world so that the powers who had always mistreated them could no longer touch them.
</p>
<p>
After the vendetta with the New York Mafia, and during the year of the Wall Street Crash, Thomas Shelby
became a Member of Parliament as a member of the Labour Party, while lending the chair of the legal
business to his older brother, Arthur Shelby.

<h3>John Shelby</h3>
<p>John idolizes the Peaky Blinders moniker, the whole image and what they stand for. Whilst he is more good
humored than his older brothers, he has the famous Shelby temper. His actions can sometimes be reckless,
but he has shown to be more similar to Thomas when dealing with the family business. While he is not as
cutthroat as Thomas or rash as Arthur, he is just as dangerous and capable.

John originally helps run the books for the Peaky Blinders, suggesting he is better with numbers and
books than his brother Arthur.</p>

<h3>Finn Shelby</h3>
<p>Finn has always been the odd one out among the Shelby siblings. He is significantly younger than the
others, and thus he didn't fight in World War I. His brothers see him as weak, immature, and lacking
experience. They believe he doesn't have the ruthlessness of a "true" Shelby. His haplessness proves to
be a liability. As he gets older, Finn becomes someone only interested in having fun and partying. He
regularly does cocaine, drinks, and womanizes. By foolishly blabbing Thomas' plans to Billy, Finn
appears to have forgotten that some matters are strictly family business, an unforgivable sin in the
Shelby family. Finn demonstrates that he is inept, unreliable, and not to be trusted. His ultimate sin
in the eyes of the Peaky Blinders is choosing his friend, Billy Grade, over family.</p>
